# Resque::LonelyJob

A [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) plugin. Requires Resque >= 1.20.0.

Ensures that for a given queue, only one worker is working on a job at any given
time.

This differs from [resque-lock](from https://github.com/defunkt/resque-lock) and
[resque-loner](http://github.com/jayniz/resque-loner) in that the same job may
be queued multiple times but you're guaranteed that first job queued will run to
completion before subsequent jobs are run.

However, it is possible that subsequent jobs are re-ordered depending upon
worker behavior.  Therefore it is recommended that the payload for jobs be
stored in a separate redis list distinct from the Resque queue (see Example #3).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'resque-lonely_job'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-lonely_job

## Usage

#### Example #1 -- One job running per queue

    require 'resque-lonely_job'

    class StrictlySerialJob
      extend Resque::Plugins::LonelyJob

      @queue = :serial_work

      def self.perform
        # only one at a time in this block, no parallelism allowed for this
        # particular queue
      end
    end

#### Example #2 -- One job running per user-defined attribute

Let's say you want the serial constraint to apply at a more granular
level.  Instead of applying at the queue level, you can overwrite the .redis\_key
method.

    require 'resque-lonely_job'

    class StrictlySerialJob
      extend Resque::Plugins::LonelyJob

      @queue = :serial_work

      # Returns a string that will be used as the redis key
      # NOTE: it is recommended to prefix your string with the 'lonely_job:' to
      # namespace your key!
      def self.redis_key(account_id, *args)
        "lonely_job:strictly_serial_job:#{account_id}"
      end

      # Overwrite reenqueue to lpush instead of default rpush.  This attempts to
      # preserve job ordering but job order is *NOT* guaranteed.
      def self.reenqueue(*args)
        Resque.redis.lpush("queue:#{Resque.queue_from_class(self)}", Resque.encode(class: self, args: args))
      end

      def self.perform(account_id, *args)
        # only one at a time in this block, no parallelism allowed for this
        # particular redis_key
      end
    end

*NOTE*: Without careful consideration of your problem domain, worker starvation
and/or unfairness is possible for jobs in this example.  Imagine a scenario
where you have three jobs in the queue with two resque workers:

    +---------------------------------------------------+
    | :serial_work                                      |
    |---------------------------------------------------|
    |             |             |             |         |
    | redis_key:  | redis_key:  | redis_key:  | ...     |
    |    A        |    A        |    B        |         |
    |             |             |             |         |
    | job 1       | job 2       | job 3       |         |
    +---------------------------------------------------+
                                      ^
                                      |
      Possible starvation +-----------+
      for this job and
      subsequent ones


  When the first worker grabs job 1, it'll acquire the mutex for processing
  redis\_key A.  The second worker tries to grab the next job off the queue but
  is unable to acquire the mutex for redis\_key A so it places job 2 back at the
  head of the :serial\_work queue.  Until worker 1 completes job 1 and releases
  the mutex for redis\_key A, no work will be done in this queue.

  This issue may be avoided by employing dynamic queues,
  http://blog.kabisa.nl/2010/03/16/dynamic-queue-assignment-for-resque-jobs/,
  where the queue is a one to one mapping to the redis\_key.
